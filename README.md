This study demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive authentication system using ASP.NET Core Identity. It includes user management, external login integrations, and cookie-based authentication mechanisms. Developed as part of a course focusing on Identity and Cookie-based Authentication, this project highlights practical applications of these technologies in a secure and scalable way.
